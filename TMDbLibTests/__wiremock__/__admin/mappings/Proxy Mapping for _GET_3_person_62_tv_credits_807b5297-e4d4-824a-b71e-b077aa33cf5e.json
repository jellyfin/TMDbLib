The Saturday edition aired live from 7 to 9 a.m. Eastern Time as well, but a number of affiliates did not carry it or aired it later on tape-delay. It premiered on November 1, 1999, and was the newest of the major networks\u0027 morning shows, although CBS has made several attempts to program in the morning slot since 1954. The show aired as a division of CBS News.\n\nThe Early Show, like many of its predecessors, traditionally ran last in the ratings to its rivals, NBC\u0027s Today and ABC\u0027s Good Morning America. Much like NBC\u0027s The Today Show and The Tonight Show, the title The Early Show was analogous to that of CBS\u0027s late-night talk show, The Late Show.",
