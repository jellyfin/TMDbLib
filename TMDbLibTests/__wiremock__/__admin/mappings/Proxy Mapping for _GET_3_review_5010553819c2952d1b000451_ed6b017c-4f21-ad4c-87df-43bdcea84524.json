      "content": "I felt like this was a tremendous end to Nolan\u0027s Batman trilogy. The Dark Knight Rises may very well have been the weakest of all 3 films but when you\u0027re talking about a scale of this magnitude, it still makes this one of the best movies I\u0027ve seen in the past few years.\r\n\r\nI expected a little more _Batman_ than we got (especially with a runtime of 2:45) but while the story around the fall of Bruce Wayne and Gotham City was good I didn\u0027t find it amazing. This might be in fact, one of my only criticisms\u2014it was a long movie but still, maybe too short for the story I felt was really being told. I feel confident in saying this big of a story could have been split into two movies.\r\n\r\nThe acting, editing, pacing, soundtrack and overall theme were the same \u0027as-close-to-perfect\u0027 as ever with any of Christopher Nolan\u0027s other films. Man does this guy know how to make a movie!\r\n\r\nYou don\u0027t have to be a Batman fan to enjoy these movies and I hope any of you who feel this way re-consider. These 3 movies are without a doubt in my mind, the finest display of comic mythology ever told on the big screen. They are damn near perfect.",
