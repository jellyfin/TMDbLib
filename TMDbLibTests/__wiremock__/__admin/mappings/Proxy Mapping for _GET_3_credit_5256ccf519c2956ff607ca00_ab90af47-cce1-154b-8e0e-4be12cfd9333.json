While his behavior  can border on antisocial, House is a maverick physician whose  unconventional thinking and flawless instincts have afforded him a great  deal of respect. House\u0027s roster of medical cases are the inexplicable  ones other doctors can\u0027t solve, and he has assembled an elite team of  young medical experts to help him in his effort to solve these  diagnostic mysteries.",

House\u0027s  methods may be suspect, but his results are not \u2014 he saves lives no one  else can. Always in House\u0027s way is Dr. Lisa Cuddy, the Dean of Medicine  and hospital administrator \u2014 and ethical gatekeeper of the hospital who  is in constant conflict with House over his extreme treatments and  unconventional behavior.

Can Princeton-Plainsboro continue its celebrated Department  of Diagnostics without him? How will Cuddy\u2019s relationship with House  change, now that their imagined affair is out in the open?",
