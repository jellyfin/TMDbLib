We all have wounds and we end up carrying around these things that people have done to us for weeks, months, and sometimes even years. It isn\u0027t always easy to forgive these people and after a while these hurts can get really heavy. So the only way to feel better seems to be somehow getting back at the people that hurt us, to get revenge. But does revenge ever truly satisfy? Maybe forgiving isn\u0027t something you do for someone else to let them off the hook. Maybe forgiveness is about you. God didn\u0027t create you to carry these wounds around. God created you to be free.",
