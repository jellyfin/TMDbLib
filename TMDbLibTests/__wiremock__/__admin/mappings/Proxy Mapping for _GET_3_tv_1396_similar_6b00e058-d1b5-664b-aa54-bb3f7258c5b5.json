Titus plays an outwardly childish adult, who owns a custom car shop. The show follows him and his dimwitted halfbrother Dave, his girlfriend Erin with the \u0022heart of gold\u0022, his goody-goody friend Tommy, and his arrogantly lewd, bigoted and multiple-divorced father Ken \u0022Papa\u0022 Titus.",
