          "content": "My god what a disappointment! The original movie had a script worth watching and some good action and special effects. This one, well this was a typical Hollywood script written by someone who either was incredibly stupid or just too arrogant to care. It is a script that I would expect from a SyFy channel production.\r\n\r\nThere was absolutely nothing that made sense in this script. The actual plot about Chernobyl that was ludicrous to say the least. I\u2019m sure the special effects guys had a great day doing the car chase at the beginning but it was just exaggerated and silly to watch. Obviously there are no cops or anything in Moscow since they could drive around smashing cars forever without anyone seeming to care. They walk into Chernobyl and sprays some magic fluid onto the highly radioactive place and voil\u00E0, the radioactivity is gone and they can take off their protective suits. What a load of bull! They steal a car and drive to Chernobyl (which is around 1000 kilometres away and the roads in Russia are NOT western highway standard) and they still manage to get there in time to catch the bad guys who are in choppers. Not to mention the fact that they actually get near the place without being stopped. I can go on with this but it is only more and more depressing.\r\n\r\nOh, my favourite (sarcasm), Switzerland have obviously invaded France since Grenoble is now in Switzerland. Funny that I, who lives a couple of hours drive from Grenoble, have not heard about this. That is just so typical dumbass American script writer who have never set foot outside of Hollywood. Maybe it was supposed to be funny but I honestly do not think so and in any case, it was not funny.\r\n\r\nThe only reason this movie gets a 4 out of 10 star rating is because the special effects are indeed impressive if you can push yourself to look past the ludicrousness of them and it is Bruce Willis after all. It is a shame that they obviously handed the franchise over to some idiot(s) that obviously where utterly incompetent at what they were doing.",

          "content": "Big, dumb, fun action flick in Russia dies hard to entertain\r\n\r\nRELEASED IN 2013 and directed by John Moore, \u0022A Good Day to Die Hard\u0022 is the Third of (currently) five installments in the Die Hard series. In this one John McClane (Bruce Willis) travels to Moscow to aid his unruly son, Jack (Jai Courtney), only to discover that Jack is an undercover agent. Father \u0026 son team-up to stop a nuclear weapons heist. Sebastian Koch is on hand as a focal point in the heist.\r\n\r\nThe Die Hard flicks fill the bill if you\u0027re in the mood for big, dumb, fun action thrills. Don\u0027t get me wrong because a lot of work goes into making these kinds of films and it takes talent \u0026 genius to pull them off. I mean \u0022dumb\u0022 in the sense that the focus is on unbelievable action rather than deeper themes beyond \u0022genuinely good people may be flawed and somewhat profane, but they\u0027re courageous and never give up in the face of evil.\u0022 Thankfully, this installment throws in some entertaining father/son character development in between the wild action sequences. McClane\u2019s daughter also appears for good measure (Mary Elizabeth Winstead).\r\n\r\nThe story isn\u0027t quite as engaging as \u0022Live Free or Die Hard\u0022 (2007), but it was good enough and the action scenes are out of this world, including a long vehicle chase in Moscow in the opening act. Director Moore ups the ante with quick-editing for this one. Some parts are eye-rolling absurd, but everything\u0027s done with a quasi-realistic tone, which sorta helps the viewer go along with the ridiculousness rather than tune out.\r\n\r\nThe Die Hard flicks are the natural progeny of over-the-top films like 1977\u0027s \u0022The Gauntlet\u0022 where the action scenes are so overdone they\u0027re cartoony, but entertaining. There\u0027s a thin line that filmmakers must tread with these kinds of blockbusters because they can easily fall into overKILL, like 2001\u0027s \u0022The Mummy Returns.\u0022 Thankfully, \u0022A Good Day to Die Hard\u0022 pretty much evades that ditch by giving us entertaining protagonists \u0026 antagonists, amusing one-liners, worthy bits of character development and a compelling comic booky story. Speaking of the story, one of the highlights is the infamous Russian location of the final act. Another highlight is hottie raven-haired Yuliya Snigir.\r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour, 38 minutes and was shot in Budapest, Hungary, with the Chernobyl scenes done at Old Soviet Air Force Base, Kiskunlach\u00E1za, Hungary, along with establishing shots of Moscow. WRITERS: Skip Woods.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B/B- (6.5/10)",

          "content": "A Good Day to Die Hard (2013) is the weakest entry in the series, losing everything that made Die Hard great in the first place. The plot is thin, the script feels hollow, and the father-son dynamic that should have added some depth comes off as forced. The action is big, but without a strong story or real stakes, it all feels empty. Bruce Willis looks like he is just going through the motions, and the villains are completely forgettable. Instead of feeling like a Die Hard movie, it plays out like a generic action flick that just happens to have John McClane in it.\r\n\r\nThe directing is a mess, with an overuse of shaky cam and quick cuts that make the action frustrating to watch rather than exciting. The cinematography lacks the creativity and tension of previous films, making everything feel flat despite the high production value. The score does its job, but it does not leave an impact, much like the rest of the movie. It is all explosions and gunfire with no heart, making this a disappointing and unnecessary sequel. If there was ever a sign that the franchise should have stopped earlier, this was it.",
